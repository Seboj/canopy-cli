<purpose>
Check project progress, summarize recent work and what's ahead, then intelligently route to the next action — either executing an existing plan or creating the next one. Provides situational awareness before continuing work.

<required_reading>
Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.

<process>

<step name="init_context">
**Load progress context (paths only):**

```bash
INIT=$(node ~/.claude/canopy/bin/canopy-tools.cjs init progress)
```

Extract from init JSON: `project_exists`, `roadmap_exists`, `state_exists`, `phases`, `current_phase`, `next_phase`, `milestone_version`, `completed_count`, `phase_count`, `paused_at`, `state_path`, `roadmap_path`, `project_path`, `config_path`.

If `project_exists` is false (no `.canopy/` directory):

```
No planning structure found.

Run /canopy:new-project to start a new project.
```

Exit.

If missing STATE.md: suggest `/canopy:new-project`.

**If ROADMAP.md missing but PROJECT.md exists:**

This means a milestone was completed and archived. Go to **Route F** (between milestones).

If missing both ROADMAP.md and PROJECT.md: suggest `/canopy:new-project`.
</step>

<step name="load">
**Use structured extraction from canopy-tools:**

Instead of reading full files, use targeted tools to get only the data needed for the report:
- `ROADMAP=$(node ~/.claude/canopy/bin/canopy-tools.cjs roadmap analyze)`
- `STATE=$(node ~/.claude/canopy/bin/canopy-tools.cjs state-snapshot)`

This minimizes orchestrator context usage.
</step>

<step name="analyze_roadmap">
**Get comprehensive roadmap analysis (replaces manual parsing):**

```bash
ROADMAP=$(node ~/.claude/canopy/bin/canopy-tools.cjs roadmap analyze)
```

This returns structured JSON with:
- All phases with disk status (complete/partial/planned/empty/no_directory)
- Goal and dependencies per phase
- Plan and summary counts per phase
- Aggregated stats: total plans, summaries, progress percent
- Current and next phase identification

Use this instead of manually reading/parsing ROADMAP.md.
</step>

<step name="recent">
**Gather recent work context:**

- Find the 2-3 most recent SUMMARY.md files
- Use `summary-extract` for efficient parsing:
  ```bash
  node ~/.claude/canopy/bin/canopy-tools.cjs summary-extract <path> --fields one_liner
  ```
- This shows "what we've been working on"
  </step>

<step name="position">
**Parse current position from init context and roadmap analysis:**

- Use `current_phase` and `next_phase` from `$ROADMAP`
- Note `paused_at` if work was paused (from `$STATE`)
- Count pending todos: use `init todos` or `list-todos`
- Check for active debug sessions: `ls .canopy/debug/*.md 2>/dev/null | grep -v resolved | wc -l`
  </step>

<step name="report">
**Generate progress bar from canopy-tools, then present rich status report:**

```bash
# Get formatted progress bar
PROGRESS_BAR=$(node ~/.claude/canopy/bin/canopy-tools.cjs progress bar --raw)
```

Present:

```
# [Project Name]

**Progress:** {PROGRESS_BAR}
**Profile:** [quality/balanced/budget]

## Recent Work
- [Phase X, Plan Y]: [what was accomplished - 1 line from summary-extract]
- [Phase X, Plan Z]: [what was accomplished - 1 line from summary-extract]

## Current Position
Phase [N] of [total]: [phase-name]
Plan [M] of [phase-total]: [status]
CONTEXT: [✓ if has_context | - if not]

## Key Decisions Made
- [extract from $STATE.decisions[]]
- [e.g. jq -r '.decisions[].decision' from state-snapshot]

## Blockers/Concerns
- [extract from $STATE.blockers[]]
- [e.g. jq -r '.blockers[].text' from state-snapshot]

## Pending Todos
- [count] pending — /canopy:check-todos to review

## Active Debug Sessions
- [count] active — /canopy:debug to continue
(Only show this section if count > 0)

## What's Next
[Next phase/plan objective from roadmap analyze]
```

</step>

<step name="route">
**Determine next action based on verified counts.**

**Step 1: Count plans, summaries, and issues in current phase**

List files in the current phase directory:

```bash
ls -1 .canopy/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
ls -1 .canopy/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
ls -1 .canopy/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-UAT.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

State: "This phase has {X} plans, {Y} summaries."

**Step 1.5: Check for unaddressed UAT gaps**

Check for UAT.md files with status "diagnosed" (has gaps needing fixes).

```bash
# Check for diagnosed UAT with gaps
grep -l "status: diagnosed" .canopy/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-UAT.md 2>/dev/null
```

Track:
- `uat_with_gaps`: UAT.md files with status "diagnosed" (gaps need fixing)

**Step 2: Route based on counts**

| Condition | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| uat_with_gaps > 0 | UAT gaps need fix plans | Go to **Route E** |
| summaries < plans | Unexecuted plans exist | Go to **Route A** |
| summaries = plans AND plans > 0 | Phase complete | Go to Step 3 |
| plans = 0 | Phase not yet planned | Go to **Route B** |

---

**Route A: Unexecuted plan exists**

Find the first PLAN.md without matching SUMMARY.md.
Read its `<objective>` section.

```
---

## ▶ Next Up

**{phase}-{plan}: [Plan Name]** — [objective summary from PLAN.md]

`/canopy:execute-phase {phase}`

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---
```

---

**Route B: Phase needs planning**

Check if `{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md` exists in phase directory.

**If CONTEXT.md exists:**

```
---

## ▶ Next Up

**Phase {N}: {Name}** — {Goal from ROADMAP.md}
<sub>✓ Context gathered, ready to plan</sub>

`/canopy:plan-phase {phase-number}`

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---
```

**If CONTEXT.md does NOT exist:**

```
---

## ▶ Next Up

**Phase {N}: {Name}** — {Goal from ROADMAP.md}

`/canopy:discuss-phase {phase}` — gather context and clarify approach

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---

**Also available:**
- `/canopy:plan-phase {phase}` — skip discussion, plan directly
- `/canopy:list-phase-assumptions {phase}` — see Claude's assumptions

---
```

---

**Route E: UAT gaps need fix plans**

UAT.md exists with gaps (diagnosed issues). User needs to plan fixes.

```
---

## ⚠ UAT Gaps Found

**{phase_num}-UAT.md** has {N} gaps requiring fixes.

`/canopy:plan-phase {phase} --gaps`

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---

**Also available:**
- `/canopy:execute-phase {phase}` — execute phase plans
- `/canopy:verify-work {phase}` — run more UAT testing

---
```

---

**Step 3: Check milestone status (only when phase complete)**

Read ROADMAP.md and identify:
1. Current phase number
2. All phase numbers in the current milestone section

Count total phases and identify the highest phase number.

State: "Current phase is {X}. Milestone has {N} phases (highest: {Y})."

**Route based on milestone status:**

| Condition | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| current phase < highest phase | More phases remain | Go to **Route C** |
| current phase = highest phase | Milestone complete | Go to **Route D** |

---

**Route C: Phase complete, more phases remain**

Read ROADMAP.md to get the next phase's name and goal.

```
---

## ✓ Phase {Z} Complete

## ▶ Next Up

**Phase {Z+1}: {Name}** — {Goal from ROADMAP.md}

`/canopy:discuss-phase {Z+1}` — gather context and clarify approach

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---

**Also available:**
- `/canopy:plan-phase {Z+1}` — skip discussion, plan directly
- `/canopy:verify-work {Z}` — user acceptance test before continuing

---
```

---

**Route D: Milestone complete**

```
---

## Milestone Complete

All {N} phases finished!

## ▶ Next Up

**Complete Milestone** — archive and prepare for next

`/canopy:complete-milestone`

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---

**Also available:**
- `/canopy:verify-work` — user acceptance test before completing milestone

---
```

---

**Route F: Between milestones (ROADMAP.md missing, PROJECT.md exists)**

A milestone was completed and archived. Ready to start the next milestone cycle.

Read MILESTONES.md to find the last completed milestone version.

```
---

## ✓ Milestone v{X.Y} Complete

Ready to plan the next milestone.

## ▶ Next Up

**Start Next Milestone** — questioning → research → requirements → roadmap

`/canopy:new-milestone`

<sub>`/clear` first → fresh context window</sub>

---
```

</step>

<step name="edge_cases">
**Handle edge cases:**

- Phase complete but next phase not planned → offer `/canopy:plan-phase [next]`
- All work complete → offer milestone completion
- Blockers present → highlight before offering to continue
- Handoff file exists → mention it, offer `/canopy:resume-work`
  </step>
